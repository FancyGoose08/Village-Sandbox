CS460 Final Project

Brainstorm:
- I want to use Unity and Blender
	- Unity for the renderer and Blender for the models
- Do I want to make a game or an animated render?
- If I make a 3D game:
	- Pro:
		- More interactive
		- Could be fun
		- Can count as one of the games I make before graduation 
	- Con:
		- A lot more coding
		- Worrying about physics
		- A lot more models have to be made in Blender

-If I make an animated render:
	- Pro:
		- Less coding
		- More creative freedom (I don't have to build around a game mechanic)
		- Less physics
		- Less blender models
	- Con:
		- More difficult
		- less interactive
- If I make an animated render you can interact with: (This one)
	- Pro:
		- More interactive than just an animation and less interactive than a game
		- Same creative freedom as an animated render with the added freedom of how 
		someone can interact with it
		- A little more physics, but still manageable
		- Same if not more blender models than just an animated model
	- Con:
		- The most work
			- All the models, animations, and how the interactions will affect
			the animation

I'm gonna make an interactable animated model.
If it looks like I won't finish in time, drop the interactable aspect

Ideas:
- What will it look like?
	- A small village
	- Low-poly
	- Cartoonish
	- Blocky (since I'm bad at modeling (for now))
	- Could use AI models 
- How will it move?
	- Villagers walking around
	- Semi-busy by default (can maybe change number of villagers to appear more or less busy)
- What will interacting it do?
	- Clicking on the screen will throw something
	- If it hits anything, do the projective behavior
	- If it hits a villager, the villager will ragdoll
	- If it hits nothing, it will disappear after a while
	- No matter what, the projectile will disappear after a while to help manage graphics
	- Scroll-wheel: change object that gets thrown
	- Different objects have different behaviors
- How can you interact with it? Mouse? Keyboard? Any other way?
	- Keep it simple. Just the mouse. That includes: position, clicking, scroll wheel
- When something hits a building, destroy the building with equal force it got hit with
- Types of projectiles:
	- Boulder
		- Big, powerful, and slow
		- Does big damage when hits a building
	- Tomato
		- Small, weak, could be fast
		- When hits anything, stops moving, splats, sticks to where it hit
			- Becomes a child of what it hit, attaching it to the parent
	- Bomb
		- Medium, on a fuse, explodes
		- Explodes in an AOE with some radius
	- Arrow 
		- Fast, only affects villagers
		- Sticks to anything it hits
Idea to make breaking buildings look better:
- Don't use kinematics
- Freeze all transformations
- Add a slightly larger circle collider as trigger on all building parts
- When a projectile enters the trigger, turn on all transformations

Completed what? when?
- Mouse interactions (placement and clicking) : 10/15
- Throwing projectile (after clicking that spawns at mouse position) : 10/15
- Basic colors so everything isn't white : 10/15
- Other projectile prefabs (no special behaviors) : 10/16
- Changing projectiles : 10/16
- Destroying projectiles with a fade after some time : 10/17
- Arrows point to where they are aimed : 10/20
- Added all building models into models folder : 10/20
- Added physics and collision to all breakable parts of the model : 10/20
- Added destructive behavior to buildings : 10/20
- Added more buildings and environment : 10/21
- Allowed randomness for tree and grass spawning : 11/16
